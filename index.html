        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring web developer who loves everything about new technology. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in different jobs but mainly in marketing and customer oriented positions. I'm excited to bring my digital marketing and growth hacking experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites that are optimized based on user's needs and values.</p>
        <p>If i'm not in an interview with a customer, or playing around with google analytics - you will find me using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to design a poster for a campaign that will go on live on social media channel.</p>
        <p>I practice box on my free time, or going out with friends for a beer on a terace that we didn't book in advance haha. I would also spend my free time playing video games with my brothers and jump into endless arguing about random topics.</p>
        <p>Even though I wanna get more techy, I'm still fan of writing. I enjoy writing a lot. I can do the "write your mind" type of text, as well a professional conversion copywritting - from creating a catchy value-proposition to feeding-up a blog page. I get inspired a lot from whatching what others are doing/accomplishing, and from reading books or blog articles.</p>
